OPTIMIZATIONS
- change project images to gifs of projects changing size from mobile to laptop back and forth
- add another page for blog posts
- add links with each portfolio piece to blog posts on how they were created
- consistently adding new porfolio porjects

LESSONS LEARNED
- as one of my first projects my biggest lesson was to give yourself room to make changes in the future
- simpler creations should equally have simple code, there is no need to add extraneous code
