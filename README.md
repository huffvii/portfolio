Included is my portfolio which was originally created in August of 2022.
It includes links and images for my portfolio pieces, an about me page, links to my social media, github, email, resume.

UPDATES
- October 2022 - added projects to portfolio page
- July 2023 - changed backgrounds and updated pictures
- August 2023 - changed home page to include portfolio page, updated about me, resume

OPTIMIZATIONS
- change project images to gifs of projects changing size from mobile to laptop back and forth
- add another page for blog posts
- add links with each portfolio piece to blog posts on how they were created
- consistently adding new porfolio porjects

LESSONS LEARNED
- as one of my first projects my biggest lesson was to give yourself room to make changes in the future
- simpler creations should equally have simple code, there is no need to add extraneous code
